<body><h1><b><u>Testing</u></b></h1>1)<strong>technique to test and ensure you have a code execution:</strong><br />• By using comments and injecting <strong>/* random value */</strong><br />• By injecting a simple concatenation <strong>"."</strong> (where <strong>"</strong> are used to break the syntax and reform it correctly).<br />• By replacing the parameter you provided by a string concatenation, for example <strong>"."ha"."cker"."</strong> instead of hacker.<br /><strong>You can also use time-based detection for this issue by using the PHP function sleep. You will see a time difference between:</strong><br />• Not using the function <strong>sleep</strong> or calling it with a delay of zero: <strong>sleep(0)</strong>.<br />• A call to the function with a long delay: <strong>sleep(10)</strong>. <br />• try “ or ‘ if it reside an error try concatenation like this "." or '.' if no error appear then try ton inject command like that “.command.” or ‘.command.’ <br />• To test if it is ruby inject this command  <strong>"%2b1.to.s%2b"</strong>.<br />• to check for python <strong>"%2bstr(True)%2b"test</strong> if str() and True are avaliable then is near python<br />• <strong>Character filter:</strong><br />This is obviously something you can only guess by trial and error(try to print character in the payload alone and figure out which one cause the error). We can go back to the previous payload using <strong>id</strong> and it will work</body></html>
